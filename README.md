# Complex Network Classification

Three networks of three different types: social, biological, and technological, were selected for classification.

### For each network model below, 30 networks were generated as a training dataset for ML models:
  - Erdo-Renyi
  - Small world
  - Barab√°si-Albert
  - Random Lobster
  - Configuration template
  - Growing network

### Machine learning models used:
  - Naive bays
  - K neighbors
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Decision tree

The source of each network classified can be found on the Jupyter file.
